# SQL-SERVER-OPTIMISATION-AUTOMATION-PROJECT
Objectives:
- Use joins to query data from multiple tables
- Create and query views
- Write and run stored procedures
- Use transactions

Scenario:
In this project, I worked with three datasets that are available on the City of Chicagoâ€™s Data Portal:
- Socioeconomic indicators in Chicago
- Chicago public schools
- Chicago crime data

I created a table for each one, and load the appropriate dataset through the Db2 console.
